# General

Everything related to development which is not configured directly in the project
or already limited by design is documented here.

## Requirements

Development with Silverware requires in general:

- git
- pre-commit enabled (not required, but strongly recommended)
- a GitHub account (which you can create totally free of charge)

## Important notes

- Always create pull requests for your changes
- If you are unsure about something feel free to reach out to the community or the core team, we are happy to help
- It's totally fine to be a bit overwhelmed at first. Take your time to understand things
