# General

silverware is written in TypeScript using Angular.

## Requirements

Development with Silverware requires in general:

- working Node.js installation
- pre-commit installed and set up
- really basic understanding of TypeScript

## Important notes

- Make sure to enable pre-commit hooks so linting etc. runs on every commit, preventing additional efforts on PR reviews
- Linting ensures our files look and feel the same no matter who develops or extends. This also means you will have to
  deal with annoying linting errors from time to time.
