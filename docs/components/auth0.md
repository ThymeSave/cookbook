Auth0
===

As Oauth2 component currently ONLY [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is supported, while the implementation should
allow other providers as well, it's not recommended nor tested.

Auth0 allows easy user management and has proven as a solid base in past projects already.

While it is free, it provides great privacy, user experience and security.
