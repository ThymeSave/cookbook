# General

Graphics are stored in the [design](https://github.com/thymesave/design) repository.

This part of the documentation covers their usage and general design guidelines.

## General

- Application is designed in a darker color scheme, for various reasons:
  - easier to read with low light
  - saves power on mobile modern devices
- We try to be compliant with [material design](https://material.io/design) where ever possible
    - in some cases custom design is required to be different or provide better UX, this is okay as long as it doesn't
      look odd

## Why Material?

It provides a mature well known design system that is familiar to users and easy to use.

Also, the integration with different UI frameworks etc. is already really good and there are many good integrations out
there.
