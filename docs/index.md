ThymeSave Cookbook
===

The central place for all our documentation, currently heavily work in progress.

## Scope

Everything related to ThymeSave will be documented here, **excluding**:

- Project setup (check the according READMEs)
- Code of Conduct (check the repositories in GitHub)
- Contribution Guidelines (check the repositories in GitHub)

## Motivation

Cooking is fun, when you have time and motivation.

Sometimes we struggle with this, as life goes on, and we just want to eat. That's where unhealthy habits like ditching
your kitchen for the fast food restaurant. Sometimes you just cook the wrong amount, or mismatch your planing with your
actual week and need to throw away food.

Something that really bothered us. We needed a solution.

Of course, there are a ton of recipe apps out there. So why not using one of them?

We tried a lot of apps out there, but every of them had something missing, e.g.:

- importing recipes in different languages is not possible or duplicates ingredients in different languages
- allowing to not add stuff you always have at home to your shopping list, resulting in more work
- only native clients you need to install on devices or native clients not for all platforms we are using
- simply too expensive
- crappy user interface
- you need to be either always online or have something like a cloud storage sync

So at the end we ended up with the idea for ThymeSave.

We in this case are:

- <a href="https://timo-reymann.de">Timo Reymann</a>

## About the name

**ThymeSave** consists is a neologism consisting of:

- Thyme (phonetic similar to time)
- Save

When you flip the order, you will notice it leads to _Save time_, and that's basically what it is all about at the end.

Since *Thyme* can also be an ingredient, it also covers the _Save the environment_ part. Save food, reduce waste!

## Vision

> The vision for ThymeSave is to provide an free, easy to use recipe app - for everyone

### Explanation

> Software is like sex: it's better when it's free.

The first thing you might notice why we listed the free? Free mainly focuses on providing the software for free.
We won't charge you for using it. We all use free software every day, and it's a good idea to give back to the
community.

While the managed service might convert to paid (because servers unfortunately cost money) the software itself will
always remain free and open to use for everyone. No matter who you are and where you are from.

The second part focuses on *easy to use* and **everyone**, this includes disabled people and your mother! We want to
keep things simple
and intuitive.

Also, everyone means no matter which language you are speaking or education you have, or even your geolocation.

### Definition / Usage

Gives the direction for the entire project and alignment for everything done in the context of the project.
While it is commonly used by companies also fits very well to the project, trying to inspire people and give a
direction.

## Mission

> Empower everyone to a healthy lifestyle while utilizing resources in an sustainable, thoughtful way.

### Definition / Usage

Gives the goal of this entire project. What it wants to achieve.

### Explanation

We all need to eat from time to time. And let's be honest: even the best chef cooks out there like to save time now and
then or just cook something, not because they like to but because they need to eat!

Not everyone enjoys cooking or planning things. Also, not everyone is able to spend much money on food.

And that's fine and well known. The goal is to make the app make you enjoy cooking and make it a breeze. No more hassles
with what to buy, what to cook, or how to plan your week.
