# ThymeSave as managed service

Not everyone is able to or wants to host the entire platform for private usage.

So here comes the free offer. Use the ready to use platform, with no tracking, and fully managed updates etc.

We will do our best to provide a stable, high available platform. But since it is not our day job we cant give you an
binding agreement.

## Service level agreements

We cant and won't provide a service level agreement like a guaranteed uptime. Since the app is built offline-first this
should also not be a problem in the first place. Since the architecture itself is built with scalability and
availability as one of the top priorities this should rarely be the case regardless.

## Provider

Currently, the Oracle Cloud Free Tier is used, which allows to run it as a cloud based service completely for free.

We are really not happy with Oracle because of the terrible support and limits, so if you like the project and want to
help
us feel free to suggest other solutions/providers!

## Disclaimer

> Please note that we keep it open to us to stop the service if it gets abused heavily or find we can no longer provide
> the service for free. Of course, we will try our best to prevent this from happening.
>
> If that should ever happen, we will give you enough time and provide assistance on migrating and provide
> alternative solutions.
